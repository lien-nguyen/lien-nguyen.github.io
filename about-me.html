      <h1>Hi, I'm Thi Bich Lien Nguyen - just call me Lien</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack Data Analyst and tech enthusiast currently working in the non-life insurance industry.
        My role as a Data Analyst extends beyond processing data, creating reports or technical implementation; 
        it involves close collaboration with cross-functional departments as well as external stakeholders to ensure results delivered align 
        with their requirements.
        Besides work, I'm passionate about experimenting with new trends and technologies on my Ubuntu and WSL 
        development workstations. I also enjoy learning guitar, boxing, and reading books.
